Running locally...

`npm ci` to install dependencies.

`npm run trace` will run with grpc-js tracing turned on for `transport,transport_flowctrl`

Client will attempt to connect to a grpc server on localhost:50051. That server can be started by running the code in the ./server folder.

Configurable settings are in the .env file. Some of the more poorly named ones:

APP_PERIOD_MS

Will print publish stats this often. This is done by monitorProgress() so you can comment that out if you don't want any stats to be printed.

APP_DELAY_MS

Wait this many milliseconds between publishing messages.
